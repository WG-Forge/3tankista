## About

The game is a turn-based strategy game based on the original World of Tanks game. The game can be played by 3 people, under the control of which there are 5 different types of equipment with their own characteristics.
The battlefield is a hexagonal grid with some special cells (obstacles, repairs, catapultas).

**There are two ways to win:**
1. Capture the central base (score 5 capture points);
2. Score the maximum number of destruction points by the end of the game.

**Tank types and characteristics:**

| Tank Type | HP  | Speed | Damage | Points for destruction |
|-----------|:---:|:-----:|:------:|:----------------------:|
| Light     |  1  |   3   |   1    |           1            |
| Medium    |  2  |   2   |   1    |           2            |
| Heavy     |  3  |   1   |   1    |           3            |
| SPG       |  1  |   1   |   1    |           1            |
| AT-SPG    |  2  |   1   |   1    |           2            |


### Architecture

The project is based on the Entity Component System design pattern. The ECS library we used is a rewritten library of [@tobias-stein](https://github.com/tobias-stein).
[Here](https://tsprojectsblog.wordpress.com/portfolio/entity-component-system/) you can see his post referred to ECS and his library.
Our implementation you can get [here](https://github.com/MedoviyKeksik/ECS).

So everything is divided in three groups:
- Entities
- Components
- Systems

**Entity** represent the main objects of the game (tank, obstacle, etc.) most of which are displayed on the map.\
**Components** store data that is inherent in an **Entity**.\
**Systems** provides functionality with a logic block for working with **Entity** and their **Components**.\
**Systems** communicate with each other using **Events**, which are implemented using the **Observer** pattern.

Internally, the **ECS engine** itself is responsible for allocating memory for the entire objects.

### Graphics

The following technology stack was used to display the data: [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/) + [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/) + [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/), a set of [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) and [FreeType](https://freetype.org/) libraries was used to display textures and text.
All sprites are rendered using the **RenderSystem**, and text is rendered using the **TextRenderer**, which is part of the **RenderSystem**. Shaders are also written (vertex and fragment shaders for displaying sprites and also vertex and fragment shaders for displaying text) using the GLSL language on OpenGL 3.3 Core.
And also [nana](http://nanapro.org/en-us/) library is used for UI.

### AI algorithm 

Artificial intelligence is a state machine for each type of tank.

## Install

### Download

Clone this repository and update submodules.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MedoviyKeksik/3tankista.git
cd 3tankista
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### For linux users

Before build, you should install following packages:
- ```libxrandr-dev```
- ```libxinerama-dev``` 
- ```libxcursor-dev``` 
- ```libxi-dev```

You can do this by running the following commands: 
```shell
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev
```

### Build
